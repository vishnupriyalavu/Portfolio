      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Chronic Disease Prediction system is a machine learning-based
        application designed to predict the risk of chronic diseases by
        analyzing patient health parameters. The goal of this project is to
        support early diagnosis and improve preventive healthcare.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Chronic diseases often remain undetected until they reach a severe
        stage. There is a need for an intelligent system that can analyze
        patient data and provide early risk prediction to assist doctors
        and patients.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses machine learning algorithms to process medical
        data such as age, symptoms, and health indicators to predict the
        likelihood of chronic diseases, enabling timely medical intervention.
